**Product details:**
* ISBN-10 ‏ : ‎ 0078136601
* * ISBN-13 ‏ : ‎ 978-0078136603
  * * Author: Ainsworth
   
  * This textbook integrates Financial and Managerial Accounting as opposed to keeping these areas separate, the approach followed by most books and curriculums. By “integration”, we mean the authors focus on the business process and examine the activities from both an external, financial reporting perspective and an internal, management decision-making perspective. The text incorporates real world applications, including actual financial statements, to reinforce the relevance of topics to real business situations and promote student interest. The text also promotes active learning through Enhance Your Understanding “probing” questions placed sporadically throughout many chapters, Of Interest boxes that provide additional information relating to the chapter concepts, Fast Fact boxes that provide additional information related to chapter concepts in a short, trivia-like manner, and end-of-chapter group exercises.
